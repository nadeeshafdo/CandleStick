# CandleStick

**CandleStick** is a web-based application designed to assist traders by providing up-to-date currency exchange rates and insights. The purpose of the project is to help traders, especially those with less experience, make informed decisions in the market. The current version allows users to select currency pairs and retrieve real-time exchange rate data.

### Project Goals:
- **Short-Term:** Provide real-time currency exchange rates using Yahoo Finance API.
- **Long-Term:** Implement machine learning algorithms to predict future market trends, enabling users to trade with greater accuracy.

This project is still under development, with the ultimate goal of creating a robust tool that leverages predictive analytics to guide traders.
